For my first project i created a very basic website that showcases  easy access and organized information for someones dnd character. 

The person intreseted fills out the form with the necerssary information. The extra charater information would be
exchaged via email. The ideal outcome is for the person to have an orgaized online file/webpage that they can access anytime with organized information of their dnd charater.

Technologies used were .html and .css

Ideas for furture improvement:
-different background colors for color-coding different characters
-actually have github connected, not sure why it's not connecting to my file :( its been trying to sych for days now :((
-better looking font

//note; omg the commits are finally showing on github. of course it would happen after the project is finshed lmao//

user stories:
1)as a user i want a way to easily and quickly acces all the information about my dnd charater. 
2)having all my refrence photos for my dnd charater and trivia in one spot to keep roleplay going smoothly is somthing crucial to me when i want to play a new charater.
3)having my own custome page for my character would help me dive more into roleplay while also easily keeping track of their health and items.
